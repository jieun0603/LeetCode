Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return *the majority element*.

The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

<br> 

**Constraints:**

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 104`
- `-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1`

**Follow-up:** Could you solve the problem in linear time and in `O(1)` space?
